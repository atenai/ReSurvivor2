Weapon Sound Pack - Explosive: C4

This note is used to help you integrate the sound in your game.
All the sounds are in different part to let you adapt them to any animation.
I hope it will help! :)

There is the sound integration in logical order.

Handling is used for character movement with the C4 in his hand.

B) Explosive_C4_Throw_###
-This sounds are used for the character trowing the C4.
-It could be combine with the Explosive_C4_handling_###, regarding your animation.

C) Explosive_C4_Impact_### / Explosive_C4_StickImpact###
-It's used for C4 stick impact on a surface.
-It's used for C4 impact on a ground.

D) Explosive_C4_Initialize_Beep_### / Explosive_C4_Beep_###
-Beeps are used for:
	-C4 initialization
	-C4 looping beep when charge is placed

E) Explosive_C4_Explosion_###
For the explosion, you have 3 types:
-Explosive_C4_Explosion_###: The explosion with a generic low reverb (you can use engine reverb with it)
-Explosive_C4_Explosion_Inside_###: It is used for inside explosion.
-Explosive_C4_Explosion_Outside_###: It is used for outside explosion.

F) Optional: Explosive_C4_Debrit_###
-Debris sounds are use at the end of the explosion to increase destruction impact
-It is optional because explosions already have a debris layer embedded.
